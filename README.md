## The Things Outdoor Gateway Spanner
[The Things Outdoor Gateway (TTOG)](https://connectedthings.store/gb/lorawan-gateways/outdoor-lorawan-gateways/the-things-outdoor-gateway-868-mhz.html) has a SIM card slot protected by a waterproof cap. This unscrews from the unit, but it's a large nut size so you need a good spanner set to find the right size, or a really big adjustable spanner. We've designed a printable spanner that makes it easy to open and close.
