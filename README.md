## The Things Outdoor Gateway Spanner
[The Things Outdoor Gateway (TTOG)](https://connectedthings.store/gb/lorawan-gateways/outdoor-lorawan-gateways/the-things-outdoor-gateway-868-mhz.html) has a SIM card slot protected by a waterproof cap. This unscrews from the unit, but it's a large nut size so you need a good spanner set to find the right size, or a really big adjustable spanner. We've designed a printable spanner that makes it easy to open and close.

No printer? The spanner is available to [buy here!](https://connectedthings.store/gb/the-things-outdoor-gateway-sim-card-spanner.html)

The spanner is designed for easy printing with no supports. We print on our Prusa i3 Mk3 using the default `0.2mm SPEED` settings and at 20% infill.
